HOW TO RUN PROGRAM?

you need SDL2 installed on your computer

get in build folder with terminal and use command:

cmake ../Framework && make && ./game

game is meant to be run at 600x800

you can run the game with custom resolution (greater than 200) by adding command -w width height f.e. -w 800 800 

but watch out, it might be buggy
